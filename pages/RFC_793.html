<h1>TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL</h1><br><br>Before you read, I highly recommend just going through the book yourself. It is highly digestable, even with little networking knowledge.<br> <br><h2>Operations</h2><br><br>Basic Data Transfer<li>TCP is able to transfer a continuous stream of octets bth directions by packaging some octets into segments</li><li>TCPs decided when to block or forward data </li><br><br>Reliablility<li>TCP must recover from data that is damaged, lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order</li><li>each octet is assigned a sequence number and requires a postitive acknowledgement (ACK)</li><li>If ACK is not received within timeout, data is retransmitted</li><li>sequence number is used at the receiver to reorganize the packets</li><li>checksum is used to verify the packet integrity</li><br><br>Flow Control<li>managed by receiver who returns a "window" with every ACK. The window indicates the number of octets that the sender may transmit before requiring permission</li><br><br>Multiplexing<li>allows for many processes within a single host to use TCP communication facilities simultaneously; TCp provides a set of addresses or ports. Network + Host address = Socket which ID's the connection</li><li>binding of ports to processes is handled by each host</li><br><br>Connections<li>in order to maintain flow control and reliability, the TCP but initialize status information for each data stream</li><li>to communicate, two processes's TTCP's must establish a connection. When communication is closed or canceled, the resources must be freed</li><br><br>Precedence and Security<li>dependant on the users</li><li>default values used if not requsted</li><br><br><h2>PHILOSOPHY</h2><br><br>Model of Operation<li>processes call TCP and pass buffers of data as arguments</li><li>TCP packages the data into segments and calls on the internet module to transmit to the destination TCP</li><li>recieving TCP decapsulates the segment and places the data into the receiving user's buffer</li><br><br>the internet module <li>packages the TCP segments inside of an internet datagram and routes it to the destiation via internet module/intermediate gateway</li><li>if local, the datagram is embedded in a local network packet</li><br><br>gateways<li>at gateways, the datagram can become "unwrapped" from it's local packet to determine which network it needs to travel next, and "re-wrapped" with a local packet suitable to the next network</li><li>gateways can also break up an internet datagram into smaller fragments (the grateway produces a set of internet datagrams, each carry a fragment of the original datagram)</li><li>this process can be done multiple times</li><br><br>destination internet module<li>unwraps the segment from the datagram (after reassembiling the fragments if necessary) and passes it to the destination TCP</li><br><br>The Host Environment<li>assumed to be in a module in an OS, controlled by a device driver module which the TCP indirectly calls when calling on the internet datagram protocol module</li><br><br>Relations to Other Protocols<li>the TCP in the protocol hierarchy</li><br><pre><br> +------+ +-----+ +-----+       +-----+<br> |Telnet| | FTP | |Voice|  ...  |     |  Application Level<br> +------+ +-----+ +-----+       +-----+<br>       |   |         |             |<br>      +-----+     +-----+       +-----+<br>      | TCP |     | RTP |  ...  |     |  Host Level<br>      +-----+     +-----+       +-----+<br>         |           |             |<br>      +-------------------------------+<br>      |    Internet Protocol & ICMP   |  Gateway Level<br>      +-------------------------------+<br>                     |<br>        +---------------------------+<br>        |   Local Network Protocol  |    Network Level<br>        +---------------------------+<br></pre><br><br>Reliable Communication<li>made available by sequence numbers and acknowledgements</li><br><br>                    <br><br><br>
