# TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL

Before you read, I highly recommend just going through the book yourself. It is highly digestable, even with little networking knowledge.
 
## Operations

Basic Data Transfer
- TCP is able to transfer a continuous stream of octets bth directions by packaging some octets into segments
- TCPs decided when to block or forward data 

Reliablility
- TCP must recover from data that is damaged, lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order
- each octet is assigned a sequence number and requires a postitive acknowledgement (ACK)
- If ACK is not received within timeout, data is retransmitted
- sequence number is used at the receiver to reorganize the packets
- checksum is used to verify the packet integrity

Flow Control
- managed by receiver who returns a "window" with every ACK. The window indicates the number of octets that the sender may transmit before requiring permission

Multiplexing
- allows for many processes within a single host to use TCP communication facilities simultaneously; TCp provides a set of addresses or ports. Network + Host address = Socket which ID's the connection
- binding of ports to processes is handled by each host

Connections
- in order to maintain flow control and reliability, the TCP but initialize status information for each data stream
- to communicate, two processes's TTCP's must establish a connection. When communication is closed or canceled, the resources must be freed

Precedence and Security
- dependant on the users
- default values used if not requsted

## PHILOSOPHY

Model of Operation
- processes call TCP and pass buffers of data as arguments
- TCP packages the data into segments and calls on the internet module to transmit to the destination TCP
- recieving TCP decapsulates the segment and places the data into the receiving user's buffer

the internet module 
- packages the TCP segments inside of an internet datagram and routes it to the destiation via internet module/intermediate gateway
- if local, the datagram is embedded in a local network packet

gateways
- at gateways, the datagram can become "unwrapped" from it's local packet to determine which network it needs to travel next, and "re-wrapped" with a local packet suitable to the next network
- gateways can also break up an internet datagram into smaller fragments (the grateway produces a set of internet datagrams, each carry a fragment of the original datagram)
- this process can be done multiple times

destination internet module
- unwraps the segment from the datagram (after reassembiling the fragments if necessary) and passes it to the destination TCP

The Host Environment
- assumed to be in a module in an OS, controlled by a device driver module which the TCP indirectly calls when calling on the internet datagram protocol module

Reliable Communication
- made available by sequence numbers and acknowledgements
- first octet of data in a segment is called the segment sequence number
- each segment also indicate which is the sequence number of the next expected data octet of transmission in reverse order
- if TCP transmits a segment containing data, it puts a copy on a retransmission queue and starts a timer, if no acknowledgement is received before the timer runs out, the segment is retransmitted.
- window frame helps govern the flow of data between TCPs

Connection Establishment and Clearing

Unique Identification
- to seperate data streams, the TCP provides a port id, but that is not unique
- to provide for unique addresses within each TCP, the internet address is concatenated with a port id to create a socket

Full Duplex
- connection which is used to carry data in both directions

Port Ownership w Processes
- there are well-known sockets which the TCP associated with "appropriate" processes
- these processes can initiate connections only on the ports they own

Socket Connection
- connection is specificed in the OPEN call by the local port and the foreign socket arguments
- the TCP provides a connection name by which the users can refer to in subsequent calls
- local connection name will be a pointer to a TCB
- the OPEN call also specifies whether the connection establishment is to be actively pursued, or to be passively waited for

Transmission Control Block (TCB)
- data structure which holds the information about a connection

Passive OPEN request
- process wants to accept incoming connection requests rather than attempting to initiate a connection
- a service process that wished to provide services for unknown other processes would issue a passive OPEN request with an unspecified foreign socket

Foreign Sockets
- foreign socket of all zeros is used to denote an unspecified socket
- unspecified foreign sockets are allowed only on **passive OPENs**.

Associating a Socket Address with a Standard Service
- well known sockets are a convenient mechanism for a associating a socket address with a standard service
- "Telnet-Server" rpocess is permanently assigned to a socket and others are reserved for File Transfer, Remote Job Entry, Text Generator, Echoer, and Sink processes
- one might be resevered for a "Look-Up" service to find specific sockets

Active OPEN request
- processes can issue passive OPENs and wait for matching active OPENs from other processes
- two processes which issue active OPENs to eachother at the same time will be connected

Principal Cases for Matching Sockets
1. local passive OPENs has fully specified the foreign socket: match must be exact
2. local passive OPENs has left the foreign socket unspecified: any foreign socket is acceptable as long as the local sockets match
- if several pending passive OPENs are targetting the same local socket, an foreign active OPEN will be matched to a TCB with the specific foreign sockets, if they exist, before selecting a TCB with an unspecified foregin socket

Connection Initiated
- rendezvous of arriving segment with SYN and a waiting TCB entry each created by a user OPEN command
- matching of local and foregin socket determines which a connection has been initiated
- connection becomes "established" which sequence numbers have been synchronized in both directions
