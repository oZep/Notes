# TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL

Before you read, I highly recommend just going through the book yourself. It is highly digestable, even with little networking knowledge.
 
## Operations

Basic Data Transfer
- TCP is able to transfer a continuous stream of octets bth directions by packaging some octets into segments
- TCPs decided when to block or forward data 

Reliablility
- TCP must recover from data that is damaged, lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order
- each octet is assigned a sequence number and requires a postitive acknowledgement (ACK)
- If ACK is not received within timeout, data is retransmitted
- sequence number is used at the receiver to reorganize the packets
- checksum is used to verify the packet integrity

Flow Control
- managed by receiver who returns a "window" with every ACK. The window indicates the number of octets that the sender may transmit before requiring permission

Multiplexing
- allows for many processes within a single host to use TCP communication facilities simultaneously; TCp provides a set of addresses or ports. Network + Host address = Socket which ID's the connection
- binding of ports to processes is handled by each host

Connections
- in order to maintain flow control and reliability, the TCP but initialize status information for each data stream
- to communicate, two processes's TTCP's must establish a connection. When communication is closed or canceled, the resources must be freed

Precedence and Security
- dependant on the users
- default values used if not requsted

## PHILOSOPHY

Model of Operation
- processes call TCP and pass buffers of data as arguments
- TCP packages the data into segments and calls on the internet module to transmit to the destination TCP
- recieving TCP decapsulates the segment and places the data into the receiving user's buffer

the internet module 
- packages the TCP segments inside of an internet datagram and routes it to the destiation via internet module/intermediate gateway
- if local, the datagram is embedded in a local network packet

gateways
- at gateways, the datagram can become "unwrapped" from it's local packet to determine which network it needs to travel next, and "re-wrapped" with a local packet suitable to the next network
- gateways can also break up an internet datagram into smaller fragments (the grateway produces a set of internet datagrams, each carry a fragment of the original datagram)
- this process can be done multiple times

destination internet module
- unwraps the segment from the datagram (after reassembiling the fragments if necessary) and passes it to the destination TCP

The Host Environment
- assumed to be in a module in an OS, controlled by a device driver module which the TCP indirectly calls when calling on the internet datagram protocol module
