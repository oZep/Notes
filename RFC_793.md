# TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL

## Operations

Basic Data Transfer
- TCP is able to transfer a continuous stream of octets bth directions by packaging some octets into segments
- TCPs decided when to block or forward data 

Reliablility
- TCP must recover from data that is damaged, lost, duplicated, or delivered out of order
- each octet is assigned a sequence number and requires a postitive acknowledgement (ACK)
- If ACK is not received within timeout, data is retransmitted.
- sequence number is used at the receiver to reorganize the packets.
- checksum is used to verify the packet integrity
